## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure Database in `backend/settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
    'NAME': 'resollect_db',
    'USER': 'your_user',
    'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': '5432',
  }

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py load_loans  # custom command if available
python manage.py runserver
```

## üîê HTTPS Note for Production

Since Vercel serves over `HTTPS`, make sure your backend also uses `HTTPS` to avoid **mixed content errors**. You can fix this by:

1. Running Django with **Gunicorn**
2. Using **Nginx** as a reverse proxy
3. Installing a free SSL certificate with **Certbot (Let's Encrypt)**

---

## üìå Remarks

- The app opens directly to the dashboard
- Navigate to **"Portfolio"** via sidebar to access full functionality
- Mixed content warning occurs if the backend is served over HTTP while frontend is HTTPS
